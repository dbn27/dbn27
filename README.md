### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dana.
I am currently in my third quarter at Drexel after graduating from Delaware State University last May with a degree in Agriculture. I also graduated with minors in Biology and Chemistry. <br>
I've been working at the Delaware Public Archives since October 2021. Where I assist the public with their records request as well as work on processing archival collections. This job has taught me a lot I did not know about Delaware history and I learn something new every day. <br>
Within the past year I started collecting vinyl records and are slowly adding to my collection. I also love to read and have a super long tbr list that I plan on working on after this quarter is finished. <br>
I knew about GitHub before this assignment but had not used it so this has been a great opportunity.

# The Global Dataset of Historical Yields for Major Crops 1981-2016
I choose this database because of my background in Agriculture. As a part of my degree I had to take a crop production course so I feel like I have utilized the data in this database within that course or another of my agriculture courses. Data was collected for maize, rice, wheat (both winter and spring), and soybean. This dataset offers annual time series data for yield estimates for each of these crops from the years 1981-2016. This dataset is helpful to track changes in the production of these crops across the world so that producers can make necessary changes to increase production to keep in line with growing populations. 

Metadata elements for this dataset include the title, description, category, language, keyworkds, version, license, and sources. 

The data is availble to download with a link the main page for this dataset. However, the files are in the .nc4 file format. This makes it difficult to actually open the individual datasets for the individual crops and years. The dataset downloads as a zip file and then is split up between crop type with individual folders. Each year within these folders is an individual .nc4 file.
