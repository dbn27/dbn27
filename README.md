### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dana.
I am currently in my third quarter at Drexel after graduating from Delaware State University last May with a degree in Agriculture. I also graduated with minors in Biology and Chemistry. 
I've been working at the Delaware Public Archives since October 2021. Where I assist the public with their records request as well as work on processing archival collections. This job has taught me a lot I did not know about Delaware history and I learn something new every day.
Within the past year I started collecting vinyl records and are slowly adding to my collection. I also love to read and have a super long tbr list that I plan on working on after this quarter is finished. 
I knew about GitHub before this assignment but had not used it so this has been a great opportunity.
